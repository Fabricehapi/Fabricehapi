- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fabricehapi.
- 👀 I’m interested in econometrics, machine learning and quantum information.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning and Quantum Modelling, and I have started with some research in Econometrics.

- While Econometrics helps in obtaining Inference results from observations (measurements), My view is that Quantum Modelling would help in understanding how such measurements affect our system of interest in order to adjust our Inference.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborations on topic related to my research interests. I also have some interests in empirical topics related to Economic Inequality, IO, Economic Institutions, Development Economics and to Culture but with an economics perspective.
- 📫 How to reach out to me: fabricehapi@gmail.com
