- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fabricehapi.
- 👀 I’m interested in econometrics, machine learning and quantum information.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning and Quantum Modelling, and I have started with some research in Econometrics.

- While Econometrics helps in obtaining some Inference results from observations (measurements), Quantum Modelling would help in understanding how the measurements affect our system of interest in order to adjust predictions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any topic related to my research interests but I also have some interests on empirical topics related to Economic Inequality, IO, Economic Institutions, Development Economics and to Culture but with an economics perspective.
- 📫 How to reach out to me: fabricehapi@gmail.com
